Because \fBscrot\fP is a command line utility, it can easily be scripted and put to
novel uses. For instance, \fBscrot\fP can be used to monitor an X server in absence.

    capture             Capture the selection area, this action is by default and
                        does not need to be specified.

    hole                Highlight the selected area overshadowing the rest of the capture.

    hide,IMAGE          Hide the selection area by drawing an area of color (or image) over it.
                        Optionally indicate name of the image to use as cover.
                        Image has priority over color.

    blur,AMOUNT         Blurs the selection area.
                        Optionally you can specify the amount of blur.
                        Amount,range: 1..30,  default: 18

.fam T
.fi
In modes 'hole' and 'hide' the color of the area is indicated by 'color' property of the
line style and the opacity of the color (or image) is indicated by property 'opacity', SELECTION \fISTYLE\fP
.PP
If the 'hide' mode uses an image that does not have an alpha channel, the opacity parameter
will be ignored and it will be drawn fully opaque.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ scrot --select=hide
    $ scrot -shole --line color="Dark Salmon",opacity=200
    $ scrot -sblur,10
    $ scrot -shide,stamp.png --line opacity=120

.SH SELECTION STYLE
When using \fB-s\fP, you can indicate the style of the line with \fB-l\fP.
.PP
\fB-l\fP takes a comma-separated list of specifiers as argument:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    style=STYLE     STYLE is either "solid" or "dash" without quotes.

    width=NUM       NUM is a pixel count between 1 and 8 inclusive.

    color="COLOR"   Color is a hexadecimal HTML color code or the name of
                    a color. HTML color codes are composed of a pound
                    sign '#' followed by a sequence of 3 2-digit
                    hexadecimal numbers which represent red, green, and
                    blue respectively. Examples: #FF0000 (red), #E0FFFF
                    (light cyan), #000000 (black).

    opacity=NUM     NUM is between 0 and 255 inclusive. 255 means
                    100% opaque, 0 means 100% transparent. For the
                    opacity of the line this is only effective if a
                    Composite Manager is running.

    mode=MODE       MODE is either "edge" or "classic" without quotes.
                    edge is the new selection, classic uses the old one.
                    "edge" ignores the style specifier and the -f flag,
                    "classic" ignores the opacity specifier.

.fam T

Without the \fB-l\fP option, a default style is used:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    mode=classic,style=solid,width=1,opacity=100

.fam T
.fi
Example:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ scrot -l style=dash,width=3,color="red" -s
